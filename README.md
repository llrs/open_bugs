# R open bugs app

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository has a shiny app to help finding issues on the [R issue tracker](https://bugs.r-project.org) needing attention.

It uses a database dump of all bugs to provide the webpage for anyone that wants to help the R core maintaining the R language and answering, confirming and fixing bug reports (or wishlist). 

It builds on this [report of bugs](https://llrs.github.io/bugzilla_viz/) using the same database dump.

If you want the current state of the database you can use [bugRzilla package](https://github.com/llrs/bugRzilla) to query it or use the [website to search](https://bugs.r-project.org/query.cgi). 

More info on [this issue](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/issues/16). Suggestions, or simply explaining how you search for bugs to participate, or how you use the app are appreciated.
